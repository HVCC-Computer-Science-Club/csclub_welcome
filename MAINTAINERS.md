# ðŸ‘¥ Project Maintainers

These are the current lead maintainers (point people) for each club-owned project.

Maintainers are responsible for:
- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Creating and managing issues
- Supporting new contributors
- Keeping the project active and healthy

Maintainers can rotate over time â€” anyone can step up!
