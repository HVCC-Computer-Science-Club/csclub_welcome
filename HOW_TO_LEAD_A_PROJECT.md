You will:

- Welcome new contributors
- Keep the README and docs updated
- Propose future ideas and features

## 👣 How to Step Up as a Lead

1. Start contributing to the project
2. Talk to an officer or open an issue like: “I’d like to help maintain this project!”
3. We’ll give you write access and add your name to [MAINTAINERS.md]('#')
4. You’re now a lead!
